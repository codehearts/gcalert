This code will access all your Google calendars and display alarms via
libnotify for whenever you have alarms set.

Libnotify alarms are, usually, little windows that _receive no focus_
(thus do not take keyboard input away from other applications) yet are
clearly visible even on a cluttered desktop.

Requirements (in debian-style package names):
python-notify python-gdata python-dateutil notification-daemon 

SECURITY NOTE: this code uses python-gdata. The current Ubuntu version
of that library, 1.2.4, will do the authentication in an encrypted
fashion but the actual calendars will be transmitted in cleartext. If
this is not what you want but instead prefer the whole exchange to occur
over an encrypted channel, consider applying the patch found at
http://groups.google.com/group/gdata-python-client-library-contributors/browse_thread/thread/48254170a6f6818a?pli=1

Also: getting 'thrown out' from Google Services is apparently normal,
GCalert will reconnect automatically.
